This is a testsuite for Haddock that uses the concept of "golden files". That
is, it compares output files against a set of reference files.

To add a new test: 

 1) Create a module in the "tests" directory.

 2) Run "cabal test". You should now have output/<modulename>.html. The test
    passes since there is no reference file to compare with.

 3) To make a reference file from the output file, do
      runhaskell accept.hs <modulename>

Tips and tricks:

To "accept" all output files (copy them to reference files), run
  runhaskell accept.hs

You can run all tests despite failing tests, like so
  cabal test --test-option=all

You can pass extra options to haddock like so
  cabal test --test-options='all --title="All Tests"'
