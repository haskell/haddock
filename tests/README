This is a little output test suit for Haddock. To add a test: 

 1 Create a module in the "tests" directory
 2 Run runtests.hs (giving it the lib dir to GHC).
   You should now have output/<modulename>.html but the test will always
   pass since there is no reference output to compare with
 3 To add reference output, do
     runhaskell copy.hs <modulename>

You can also do
  runhaskell copy.hs
to copy all output into reference files
