-- Haddock 2.6.0
--------------------------------------------

A new version of Haddock, the Haskell documentation tool, is out!

This is the version that comes with GHC 6.12.1. It contains the main results of
Isaac Dupree's Summer of Code project, which are:

  * Cross-package documentation (exporting something that comes from another
    package is handled correctly. The full documentation of that thing shows
    up in your documentation)

  * Lexing and parsing of Haddock comment markup is moved from GHC back into
    Haddock. This will make it easier to make changes to the markup format

We have decided to drop compatibility with older GHC versions in order to speed
up development.

--------------------------------------------
