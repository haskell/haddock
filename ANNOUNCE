-- Haddock 2.4.0
--------------------------------------------

A new version of Haddock, the Haskell documentation tool, is out.

This is a later version than the Haddock shipped with GHC 6.10.1, which is
version 2.3.0. That version will not be released on Hackage since it only
builds with GHC 6.10.1 (by accident, actually).

Compared to 2.3.0, this release contains some more fixes and support for HTML
frames. 

Please use the bug tracker to submit bug reports and feature requests.

--------------------------------------------
-- Changes in version 2.4.0

  * Add framed view of the HTML documentation

  * Build with GHC 6.8.2 and 6.8.3 again

  * Support images in documentation comments again

  * Small improvements to the Hoogle output

  * A few bugs has been fixed

--------------------------------------------
-- Changes in version 2.3.0
--------------------------------------------

  * Support for GHC 6.10.1

  * Slightly improved space usage

  * Fix a bug that made hidden modules show up in the contents & index pages

  * Fix a bug that made Haddock load modules twice

  * Improvements to the Hoogle output
