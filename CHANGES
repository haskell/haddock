Changes in version 0.8:

  * Haddock has a Cabal build system, and will build on Windows without
    Cygwin or MSYS.  GHC 6.4 or later is required.

  * New options: --comments-base, --comments-module, --comments-entity
    for generating links to pages (eg. wiki) for collecting user comments.

  * New options: --source-base, --source-module, --source-entity
    for generating links to source code.  Haddock now understands
    {-# LINE #-} pragmas, which means it can figure out the correct
    name for the source file even if the file is preprocessed.

  * Haddock generates output for populating the Hoogle search engine.

  * New markup <<url>> for including images.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in version 0.7:

  * Changes in the way Haddock decides where to direct hyperlinks.  Each entity
    is now assigned a single "home" module, and all hyperlinks are directed
    to that module.  See the docs ("Hyperlinking and re-exported entities")
    for details.

  * New options --ignore-all-exports, --hide

  * New option --use-package for creating documentation that hyperlinks to
    the HTML documentation for existing packages on your system.  It works
    by querying ghc-pkg for the location of the Haddock interface and
    HTML for the given package.

  * Parts of the HTML documentation, notably lists of instances, are
    now "collapsible" with a +/- button.  Also, the contents page is now
    in the form of tree in which subtrees can be collapsed.

  * Support for Microsoft DevHelp and HtmlHelp 2.0 formats.

  * Support for a short description for each module for the contents page.

  * Compiles with GHC 6.4+

  * Various bugfixes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in version 0.6:

  * Implicit parameters, zip comprehensions and 'mdo' are now
    supported by the parser.

  * Some lexical bugs were fixed, mainly concerning literal paragraphs
    next to non-literal paragraphs.

  * New options:  --gen-index, --use-index, --gen-contents and --use-contents,
    for generting a combined index and contents for several libraries
    from the appropriate .haddock files.

  * There is now one index rather than separate Function/Constructor and
    Type/Class indices.  Where a name refers to several entities, these
    are listed separately in the index.

  * New option: -v, elicits more verbose warnings.  Some warnings are
    now turned off by default; Haddock should be a little less noisy
    in general.

  * Markup for definition lists has been added.  See the documentation 
    for details.

  * New option: --package for setting the package name.  The package
    is listed alongside each module name in the combined contents.

  * Entities which are re-exported from another package now at least
    leave a hyperlink in the generated HTML, rather than nothing at all.

  * Some fixes for bugs which caused incorrect hyperlinks in the
    generated HTML.  In particular, instances should now be linked
    correctly.

  * Some aesthetic improvements to the generated HTML.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in version 0.5:

  * Compiles with recent versions of GHC.

  * A few bugs have been fixed.

  * New labelling/linking feature (see "Anchors" in the manual).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in version 0.4:

  * Import declarations which list entities in parentheses, or with
    hiding clauses, are now properly supported.  Modulo one or two
    small infelicities, the full Haskell modules system is now supported.

  * Haddock is now more flexible about the placing of separators
    (commas, semicolons) in relation to doc comments.

  * There is support for generating and reading "interface files"
    which describe the exports of a set of modules.  This is useful
    for generating documentation which hyperlinks to
    previously-generated documentation.
    
  * Support for generating the extra files required by the Microsoft
    Help compiler.

  * New option: --prologue specifies a file of documentation which is
    placed on the contents page.

  * Many bugs fixed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.3:
  
  * Documentation on individual function arguments is now implemented 
  
  * Links can be made to identifiers that aren't in scope, by using
    the fully qualified name.

  * Instances are collected and listed with the appropriate classes
    and datatypes (not for derived instances yet).

  * Single quotes are only interpreted specially when they surround a
    legal Haskell identifier, otherwise they are treated literally.

  * Bird-tracked text is now literal.  If you want marked-up text in
    a code block, use the @...@ notation instead.

  * Various changes to the layout, it generally looks nicer now.

  * Various bugs fixed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.2:

  * The [...] markup for typewriter font has been changed to @...@.

  * Module attributes introduced (see the documentation for details).

  * {- ... -} style comments may now be used for documentation annotations

  * Recursive modules are detected and reported as an error.

  * Existential constructors and rank-N types are now groked by the parser

  * Some type rendering cleaned up

  * `abc' is accepted as well as 'abc' to markup an identifier

  * Several bugs fixed, and error messages improved.
