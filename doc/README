Haddock documentation
---------------------

The documentation is in DocBook XML format.  You need some tools to
process it: at least xsltproc, and the DocBook XML DTD and XSL
stylesheets.  There's a configure script to detect the right way to
process the documentation on your system, and a Makefile to actually
do the processing (so, on Windows, you'll need Cygwin or MSys in
addition to the DocBook XML tools).  To build the HTML documentation:

   $ autoconf
   $ ./configure
   $ make html

which leaves the HTML documentation in a haddock/ subdirectory.

Printable documentation can also be produced, eg.:

   $ make pdf

or

   $ make ps

Generating the printed formats requires more tools (fop or xmltex) and
tends to be a bit harder.
